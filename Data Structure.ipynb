    "-> **Data structures** are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They define the relationship between the data and the operations that can be performed on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Types of Data Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arrays** – Fixed-size sequences of elements.\n",
    "2. **Linked Lists** – A series of nodes, each pointing to the next.\n",
    "3. **Stacks** – LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure.\n",
    "4. **Queues** – FIFO (First In, First Out) structure.\n",
    "5. **Trees** – Hierarchical structure (e.g., binary trees, AVL trees).\n",
    "6. **Graphs** – Nodes connected by edges, used to represent networks.\n",
    "7. **Hash Tables (Hash Maps)** – Key-value pairs for fast lookup.\n",

    "2. **Organization**: They help manage and organize data logically, making code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "3. **Reusability**: Many programming libraries and frameworks provide built-in data structures that can be reused across applications.\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: Efficient data structures help applications handle large volumes of data and scale effectively.\n",
    "5. **Problem Solving**: Many computational problems require specific data structures for optimal solutions, such as using graphs for network routing or trees for hierarchical data.\n"
